						<h3>Engineer</h3>
						<p>Graduating from Engineering Physics at UBC, with a specialty in Electrical, a Minor in Commerce and a course short of an Honours in Mathematics, I’ve applied this towards a career in consulting engineering services for electrical systems of buildings. From world-class sustainability projects to hospitals; single family homes to low-income housing; and, offices to data-centres, I’m grateful and proud to have helped hundreds of clients and stakeholders, and build communities that have served tens of thousands more.</p>
					</div>

					<div class = "character_slide">
						<h3>Artist</h3>
						<p>I'm proud to complement my STEM credentials with an eye for aesthetics and prose. This creativity has helped in preparing winning marketing materials and proposals, supplementing business development goals. My talents for photography have helped win lighting awards on my projects; helped a friend (and hopefully two) win an election; and supported a photography business on the side. It is now helping me build this website.</p>
					</div>

					<div class = "character_slide">
						<h3>Problem Solver</h3>
						<p>Engineers have no monopoly in problem solving. The most valued individuals in an organization describe their days as solving problems. This has served me well beyond the technical as I apply creative solutions to many problems without a strict technical solution. From personnel management, business acquisition, project management, stakeholder analysis and more, I strive to improve the organization: sell more stuff, to more people, more often, for more money, more efficiently.</p>
					</div>

					<div class = "character_slide">
						<h3>Leader</h3>
						<p>I’m honoured by the opportunity to have led many different groups over my life. From humble beginning as captain on various sports teams to leading diverse engineering teams on hundred million dollar projects, I do not take the trust invested in me lightly. From trust invested from business leaders; trust from colleagues on technical expertise; trust from nominations and voting in volunteer positions, I reward that trust by helping those around me succeed in their own ambitions.</p>

										<p>Photonic crystals are the optical analog to electronic semi-conductors. Instead of using electrons to carry signals and logic, photons are proposed instead. There are many challenges with this approach as photons are weakly interacting compared to electrons, thus needing significant amplification to rely on non-linear responses. A photonic crystal, through constructive and destructive interference, permits one to manipulate band-structures, similar to how semi-conductors permit changes to band-structures for electron transmission. Both involve introducing defects into the crystal structure to manipulate the band-gaps.
										</p>
										<p>
										Shown here are 2D planar photonic crystals, which rely upon in-plane photonic crystal confinement, and out-of-plane confine through total-internal-reflection. The defect is introduced in the center of the hexagonal crystal, where photons will be amplified for the non-linear behaviour.
										</p>
										<p>
										I was involved in specific experiments, creating these planar photonic crystals using UV-lithography and plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition and desublimation. Further techniques involved FDTD simulations; conventional chemistry in clean rooms; mechanical transfer and substrate removal; and, characterization with laser spectrometers and scanning electron microscopes.
										</p>
										<p>
										What I took away most from this experience was how quickly it was possible to go from a bright-eyed and naive highschool student, to contributing in a world-class, applied physics research team, using state-of-the-art apparatus and life-threatening chemistry, only a year and a half removed from high-school.

										Interior Heart and Surgical Centre is a new, 150,000sqft hospital building, expanding the Kelowna General Hospital campus. The four-storey building includes space for sixteen operating rooms, over thirty in-patient beds, medical-device-reprocessing, a cardiac revascularization program, intensive care suite, perinatal care, NICU,  and support spaces. At a budget of $200M*, the project was delivered under the private-public partnership model, with considerations to ongoing hospital operations, and significant schedule risks and cost. Additional requirements included LEED Gold certification, and incorporating significant wood elements to meet BC’s Wood First Act.
										</p>
										<p>
										The project was an intense and complicated partnership amongst all stakeholders from physicians to hospital administration; financiers to construction teams; and design to operations. Agile principles were adopted to iterate quick solutions for consideration by the users and Lean principles were used while parallelizing construction and design.
										</p>
										<p>
										I feel immense pride for contributing to a substantial expansion to healthcare within the community, acting as Project Manager for MMM’s multidisciplinary design team of Civil, Electrical, Energy Modelling, Integration Management, Information Technology, Landscape, Mechanical and Sustainability Design and Engineering services.

										<p>The Wood Innovation and Design Centre serves as a multi-use building, housing both the University of Northern British Columbia’s Master’s program in Integrated Wood Design, as well as general office space. At the time of completion, it was the tallest, all-wood building in North America, though at a modest 30m height across six storeys plus mezzanine and penthouse. It was a pioneer for demonstrating sustainable construction for high-rise building classification, historically relying on concrete and steel above a certain height or number of floors. The innovative structure relied significantly on engineered wood product composites, including glulam beams, cross-laminated timber and laminated veneer lumber.
										</p>
										<p>
										I had the fortune of contributing to the electrical design including power distribution, lighting design, ICT distribution, life-safety and security systems. Special attention was required to route electrical raceways through unique wood structural components, largely exposed, to minimize visual noise.

										UBC’s Quantum Matter Institute is a state-of-the-art research facility, extending the existing Brimacombe (Advanced Materials and Process Engineering Laboratory) building with complementary research space and facilities. At approximately 50 ksqft, and a budget of 30M, it added sufficient space for dozens of research teams, focusing on everything from ultra-fast lasers, to bio-engineering, and ultra-low vibration condensed matter physics.
										</p>
										<p>
										QMI holds a special place in my heart as AMPEL was the very building where I had the privilege of working with Dr. Jeff Young’s team, creating the very photonic crystals noted amongst my projects. Further, it provided me an opportunity to also help design expansions to Dr. David Jones’ lab (per my professional experience) and another former professor of mine, Dr. Andrea Damascelli, working with condensed matter.
										</p>
										<p>
										The electrical design was of particular interest and challenge due to the requirement to meet ultra-low noise on both vibrations and electrical noise. This involved special considerations to harmonic mitigating transformers, robust grounding systems, electrical shielding, special mechanical coupling, investigations into double-conversion UPS’s and more. Further challenges were added for warning, alarm and emergency stand-by systems. I led the design from schematic to the beginning of construction documents.

										UniverCity Childcare Centre is a daycare serving the nearby community of Simon Fraser University. It was built targeting the ambitious, Living Building Challenge (LBC) standard, whose philosophy extends beyond even net-zero energy and water standards, and demands a building which  positively adds to its environment. Its metrics use a flower as a metaphor for success, each petal representing a different criteria to meet, from water to energy and social equity to beauty.
										</p>
										<p>
										The project was a highly collaborative effort to ensure the various building systems worked in harmony to achieve the goal. Strong considerations were made for efficient devices, minimizing distance for sourcing of materials, and restricting toxic material components. Additionally, systems were designed to complement the use of the facility, which included aesthetics to inspire and increase occupant health and productivity.
										</p>
										<p>
										The project was largely successful; however, due to regulatory challenges on potable water, combined with using non-chemical means for water treatment, it was unable to meet this single challenge; though, the project was successful in all other aspects and was greatly welcomed by the stakeholders for being under budget, and praised by the local community and sustainability community at large.
										</p>
										<p>
										I was proud to contribute significantly, being the sole designer from design development through construction. Unsurprisingly, the largest challenges were the uniqueness and high requirements of the LBC standard, which involved significant research into systems which would meet restrictions such as the inability to use PVC conduit or insulation.
										</p>

I list this project as a far more personal one as I was happy to modestly contribute to her election bid in 2017, providing photography for her portrait, her events, and volunteering in her campaign. While I take very little credit for my contribution, I am proud to have a small part in her historic win, changing an opposition stronghold of over 25 years.

											The University of Northern British Coulmbia’s Bio-Energy Plant was a facility which was strategically located to take advantage of the significant local forestry industry, by using wood-byproducts as fuel. The facility used an advanced wood-gasification system, which aids greatly in combustion efficiency. An operations and research component was also designed to monitor and study the system and its impacts.
										</p>
										<p>
										The project was constructed to complement UNBC’s campus-scale ‘district’ energy system, providing the campus with 71% of its heating energy needs, and allowed the university to reduce fossil fuel consumption by 85%. The project was a significant factor in UNBC’s shared win for AASHE’s most sustainable university in 2010, tying Harvard University in the honour.
										</p>
										<p>
										Additionally, while the project targeted LEED Gold, the team was so successful in meeting its objectives, that we were able to achieve the prestigious LEED Platinum Certification - a first for a university building in BC, and the second industrial building in Canada.
										</p>
										<p>
										This was a project I was proud to contribute to early in my career. Despite my inexperience, I was relied upon significantly to design the majority of the project, as well as a significant contributor to the construction administration responsibilities.
